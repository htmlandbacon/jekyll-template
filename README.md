## DWP Jekyll Site Generator

This is a example of a jekyll site generator.

To run the site you will need npm installed, this will get various modules for grunt tasks and govuk modules.

```
npm install
```

To run the project, type:

```
gulp
```

A few notes:

- The site is served from **dev/_site**
- the sass is under **dev/_sass** folder.
- Currently govuk-template are under **dev/layouts**
- Currently govuk-template assets are under **dev/_layout**
- partials for govuk-template are under **dev/_includes/layout**


Todo:

- gulp scripts
- Tidy up loading of assets
